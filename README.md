# String Manipulation Practice

This repository contains various C programs focused on string manipulation techniques. These are part of my preparation for on-campus technical interviews. Each code demonstrates a different concept or method related to handling and manipulating strings, from basic operations to more complex transformations.

## About
String manipulation is a fundamental topic in programming interviews. This repository includes C programs Iâ€™ve written while practicing for upcoming interviews. These programs aim to improve understanding of common string operations, such as:
- Reversing strings
- Manipulating substrings
- Word-level transformations
- Palindrome checking
- String sorting
- Anagram detection

## Programs

| Program Name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `reverse_words.c` | Reverses the order of words in a string. |
| `palindrome_check.c` | Checks if a string is a palindrome. |
| `substring_search.c` | Implements a basic substring search. |
| `remove_duplicates.c` | Removes duplicate characters from a string. |
| `anagram_check.c` | Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other. |

## Usage
To compile and run any program:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/strings-c.git
